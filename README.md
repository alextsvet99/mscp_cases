# OpenFOAM cases for MSc project

This repository stores the main test cases which were used in my MSc project. The cases can be used as a tutorial for setting up an overset meshes case and a morphing mesh case.

## steady_rotation_isolated

This case demonstartes the base case where only trubine rotation is considered. The rotaton is implemented using the slidimg mesh interface (AMI in OpenFOAM terms).

## overset_meshes

This case demonstrates the set up of overset meshes. Both rotation and surge are included.
